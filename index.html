      Love, from the moment I met you, I knew you were someone special. You're the treasure I never knew I needed, the missing piece that makes me whole.

      I love you so much, not just for who you are, but for who you help me to be. You're my rock, my partner, and my best friend.

      No matter what anyone says or tries to criticize, you're still the best thing that's ever happened to me. I'm grateful for every moment we share, every laugh, every tear, and every adventure.

      Love you, darling. Stay strong; we're heading somewhere amazing soon, and the best is yet to come. Happy Valentine's Day, my treasure!
